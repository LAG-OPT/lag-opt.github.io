### Website for Optical Projection Tomography data from the Laser Analytics Group

This repository contains the most up-to-date version of OptiJ, an ImageJ plugin for denoising and reconstructing Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) data. Links to 3D visualizations of the data acquired using our open-source hardware and reconstructed using OptiJ can be found below. For any questions or comments, please contact Pedro Vallejo Ramirez, ppv23@cam.ac.uk.

To use the plugin, download the [Opti_J.jar](https://github.com/LAG-OPT/lag-opt.github.io/blob/master/Opti_J.jar) file and paste it into the plugins folder of your current version of Fiji/ImageJ. Restart imageJ, and OptiJ is ready for use!

Documentation for OptiJ can be found in the following repository: [OptiJ documentation](https://github.com/pedropabloVR/ImageJ-Recon-Plugin-Java)

The latest stable version of the source code (for further development or patches) can be found in: [OptiJ source code](https://github.com/pedropabloVR/2D_Reconstruction_patched)

### Sample data
5 individual lobes from adult murine lungs were extracted, dehydrated, stained, and cleared for OPT. Visualizations of the reconstructed data can be found in the following links. The open-source package FPBioimage ([Fantham & Kaminski, Nature Photonics 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphoton.2016.273)) was used to render and share the reconstructed data.

1. [Left lobe, anti surfactant C](https://lag-opt.github.io/lungs/autofluorescent-250/)
2. [Medial lobe, anti TFF1](https://lag-opt.github.io/lungs/right-middle-250/)
2. [Medial lobe, anti TFF1, cropped](https://lag-opt.github.io/lungs/right-middle-cropped/)
3. [Accessory lobe](https://lag-opt.github.io/lungs/accesory-250/)
4. [Left lobe, anti TFF1](https://lag-opt.github.io/lungs/large-left-250/)
5. [Superior lobe, anti TFF1](https://lag-opt.github.io/lungs/right-upper-250/)

### Videos
