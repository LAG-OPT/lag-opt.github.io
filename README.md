### Website for Optical Projection Tomography data from the Laser Analytics Group

This repository contains the most up-to-date version of OptiJ, an ImageJ plugin for denoising and reconstructing Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) data. Links to 3D visualizations of the data acquired using our open-source hardware and reconstructed using OptiJ can be found below. For any questions or comments, please contact Pedro Vallejo Ramirez, ppv23@cam.ac.uk. 

The documentation for OptiJ can be found in the following repository: [bit.ly/OptijSource.]
The latest stable version of the source code can be found in: [https://github.com/Josephzammit90/2D_Reconstruction_patched]

### Sample data
5 individual lobes from adult murine lungs were extracted, dehydrated, stained, and cleared for OPT. Visualizations of the reconstructed data can be found in the following links. The open-source package FPBioimage (Fantham & Kaminski, Nature Photonics 2017) was used to render and share the reconstructed data. 

1. Autofluorescent lobe:
2. Right middle lobe
3. Accessory lobe
4. Left lobe
5. Right upper lobe
